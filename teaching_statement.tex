\maketitle

The student should inspire the teacher to teach and not the other way around.
The teacher does not teach but a student learns like pulling a cup of water from 
a flowing river.
Its the responsibility of the teacher to inculcate interest in the topic amongst the students.
Once the interest is ignited, the teaching automatically happens.

Also, the application part of the theoretical facts is often missed out.
When teaching about geometry , for example, we often miss out the significance of irrational
numbers such as $\pi$. Whole treatises have been written about the topic
